              <h3>PERMISSION MANAGEMENT SYSTEM</h3>
                <p>The permission management system takes all the permissions online. There are three
kinds of designations assigned-Employee, Leader and Manager. If the leader accepts and
Manager rejects it the the permission will be showed as rejected. If leader and manager
accept then the status will be accepted. If leader rejects and manager accepts then the
status will be accepted as manager has final say. These statuses will be displayed on the
dash board of the employee.</p>

              <h3>QUANTIFYING BLOCK CHAIN IMMUTABIITY OVERTIME</h3>
                <p>Immutability is a term used a lot in block chain and crypto currency development when
attempting to analyze the economic interpretation of a network. Designs like the
21million Bitcoin supply in BTC or incidents like the DAO fork bailout that split the
Ethereum of community into ETH and ETC are major examples of immutability values
determining the ethos of a chain. This research sets out to categorize different features of
blockchain immutability and analyze them in three different networks: Bit coin (BTC),
Ethereum (ETH), and Ethereum Classic (ETC). Further in the paper, the Finney Ratio is
introduced to help understand how block chain immutability can be measured overtime.
The paper then visualizes overall blockchain immutability over time using radar charts as
an immutability map. The Szabo Score is then introduced as a tool to score over all
Immutability over time for each block chain.</p>
